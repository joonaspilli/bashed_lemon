# Bashed Lemon

A bash + lemonbar setup for printing useful information about system activity. Offers primary output to either a statusbar (lemonbar) or stdout.

This project is created for my personal needs and its features are lacking for general-use. Existing features may be environment specific, although an attempt is made to avoid such cases when possible. In its current form I don't recommend anyone else to use this script, but it can offer examples of possible implementations and syntax for similar needs.
